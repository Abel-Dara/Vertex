                    <h3>portfolio website</h3>
                    <p>In an increasingly digital world, a portfolio website is a must-have for showcasing 
                        your skills, work, and achievements. Whether you're a designer, developer, photographer, 
                        writer, or any creative professional, a well-designed portfolio site serves as a powerful 
                        tool to attract clients, employers, or collaborators.</p>
                    <p>A portfolio website is a personal or professional platform where individuals display 
                        their work, skills, and achievements. Unlike a resume or social media profile, it provides 
                        a more dynamic and visually engaging way to present your expertise.</p>
                       <p>A portfolio website is more than a showcase; it’s a reflection of your personal brand 
                        and a gateway to career opportunities. By carefully designing and curating your site, 
                        you can stand out in a competitive landscape and leave a lasting impression on visitors.</p>

                    <h3>Personal Website</h3>

                        what you do, and what you care about. Unlike social media platforms or professional 
                        networking sites, a personal website gives you full control over your content, branding, 
                        and message. Whether you’re building a professional profile, a creative portfolio, or a 
                        blog to share your thoughts, a personal website is a versatile tool that can help you stand 
                        out online.</p>
                    <p>A personal website is more than just a digital resume or portfolio—it’s a reflection of who 
                        you are and a tool for showcasing your talents, passions, and achievements. In a competitive 
                        digital landscape, having your own website sets you apart and gives you a professional edge.</p>
